# sonar-rock-vs-mine-ML-project-
The Sonar Rock vs. Mine Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning solution to distinguish sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders (simulating rocks) from those bounced off mine-like objects. Using a dataset of sonar signal features, the project implements various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests. Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score assess model performance, ensuring robustness with cross-validation techniques. Implemented in Python using scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, the project provides Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for easy experimentation and visualization. By open-sourcing on GitHub, the project aims to contribute to underwater object detection research, potentially enhancing safety and efficiency in underwater surveillance and navigation. Future developments may explore advanced techniques and real-time processing for practical deployment.
